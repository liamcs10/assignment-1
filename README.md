Liam Carpenter-Shulman

I am a Junior studying Economics and Environmental Studies. I took this class because I want to have skills that I can apply to interdisciplinary research questions. I want to work in my early career as an Environmental Economics consultant/policy developer before eventually going into politics. I play soccer.
